 About

When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.


Stage 1/7: Stage one, card one
Display information about a single card on the screen.

Stage 2/7: Whats's on the card?
Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the user’s answer on the screen.

Stage 3/7: Make it your own
Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.

Stage 4/7: A good stack
Learn to use hashtables, display key values, and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.

Stage 5/7: Menu, please!
Work with files: create a menu that allows you to add, delete, save, and upload saved cards in your game.

Stage 6/7: Statistics
Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve.

Stage 7/7: IMPORTant
Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments.
