<html><body><p>Suppose we have a file <strong> songs.txt</strong> that contains a single line: <strong>Space Oddity</strong>. We have implemented the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f = open('songs.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
f.write('Life on Mars')
f.close()</code></pre>
<p>What will be the contents of <strong>songs.txt </strong>after this?</p></body></html>
