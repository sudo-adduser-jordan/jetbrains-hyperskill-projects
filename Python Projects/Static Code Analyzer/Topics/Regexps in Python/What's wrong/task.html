<h2>What's wrong?</h2>
<p>There are two words in the input. You decide to create a small program that checks if the words match or not. If they do match, the program prints the doubled length of the word from the input, and if they don't, it prints the string "no matching".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are some errors in the program. Find and correct them.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
