<h2>What year is it?</h2>
<p>Now it is time to practice your regexp writing skills! Write a regular expression in the variable <code class="java">template</code> in such a way that it would match the years from 2000 to 2019 (including 2019). Note that your template should not match any other year or random strings that do not contain any year at all. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
