<h2>Owls</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Here we have the decorator <code class="language-python">nighttime</code> and the function <code class="language-python">get_message</code> that we pass to it. However, right now, the code is not going to work as there is something wrong with it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def nighttime(func):
    def wrapper():
        print('It is nighttime')
        return func()

    return wrapper


@nighttime
def get_message(name):
    print('We can hear some night birds like', name)


get_message('owls')</code></pre>
<p>What should we do to make it work properly and get the following message output?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># It is nighttime
# We can hear some night birds like owls</code></pre>
