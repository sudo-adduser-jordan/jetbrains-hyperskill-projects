<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>Write a function called <code class="java">multiply</code> that takes a changeable number of arguments and returns their product.</p>

<p>Assume that only integer numbers are to be passed into the function.</p>

<p>Given only one integer number, multiply it by 1. Thus, the product will be equal to this integer.</p>

<p>You are not supposed to call the function, simply implement it.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
