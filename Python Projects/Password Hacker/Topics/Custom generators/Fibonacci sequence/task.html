<h2>Fibonacci sequence</h2>
<p><strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong> is a sequence of numbers such that each element is a sum of the previous two, and the first two elements are equal to 0 and 1. For example, the first 10 numbers in the sequence will look as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34</code></pre>

<p>Define a generator that produces the Fibonacci sequence of the given length <code class="java">n</code>.</p>

<p>You don't have to handle the input, just implement the generator function called <code class="java">fibonacci</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
