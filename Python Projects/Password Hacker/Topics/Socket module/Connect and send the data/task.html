<h2>Connect and send the data</h2>
<html><body><p>In the code below, you are given a function <code class="java">submit_data()</code> that takes data, a client socket, and a connection address.</p>
<p>Finish the code by connecting the socket to this address and sending the data to the server. The data has the <code class="java">str</code> type, so you may need to convert it to <code class="java">bytes</code> first.</p>
<p>You don't have to receive any response from the server, however, it might be a good idea to end the connection, when you're done.</p>
<p>Just implement the function, no other actions are required.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
