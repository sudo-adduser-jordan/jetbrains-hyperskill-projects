## Learning outcomes

Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.

## About

Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

## Stages

Stage 1/6: Addition
Use multi-dimensional arrays to add matrices.

Stage 2/6: Mulitplication by number
Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result.

Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication
Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your matrix processor.

Stage 4/6: Transpose
Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition, and then add this option to the menu.

Stage 5/6: Determined!
Use recursion to enable your program to find the determinant.

Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix
Yet another possible operation is finding the inverse of a matrix: add this option to your program
